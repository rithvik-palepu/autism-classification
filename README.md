## Getting Started
1) Clone this repo
   - git clone https://github.com/rithvik-palepu/autism-classification.git
   - cd autism-classification
     
2) Install Dependencies
   - pip install -r "requirements.txt"

3) Download ABIDE Data
   - Visit http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/abide/
   - Choose a pre-processing pipeline
   - place .mat or .csv connectivity files into data/raw/

4) Run Jupyter Notebooks in order
   - 01_explore.ipynb → data inspection
   - 02_features.ipynb → feature creation
   - 03_models.ipynb → ML training
   - 04_interpret.ipynb → analysis & figures

## Repro
  - Python 3.10+
  - Random seed: 42
  - All transformations (scaling, PCA, feature selection) occur inside CV folds to avoid data leakage.
  - Metrics reported: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and site-wise generalization.
